# Welcome to the Diabetes Data Analysis Project

## About the Dataset

Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, impacting millions peaple each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, leading to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. Complications associated with chronically high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream for those with diabetes include heart disease, vision loss, lower-limb amputation, and kidney disease.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used. This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.

This project utilizes three data files:

- **diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv:** A clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes: 0 for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 for prediabetes, and 2 for diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables.

- **diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv:** A clean dataset of 70,692 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. It has an equal 50-50 split of respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes: 0 for no diabetes, and 1 for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is balanced.

- **diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv:** A clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes: 0 for no diabetes, and 1 for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.

## Research Questions

Some of the research questions explored in this project include:

1. Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?

2. What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?

3. Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?

4. Can we create a short form of questions from the BRFSS using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the work of Zidian Xie et al. on Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques using the 2014 BRFSS.
